# heart_disease_classification
•	Used a UCI dataset and did Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib to have clear view on the dataset
•	Trained the prepared classification data using Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors and RandomForest 
•	Did Model evaluation under accuracy score i.e. which model have best accuracy under test data we’ve split.
•	Compared a Model under how well each model performed
•	Performed a Model fine-tuning using several hyperparameter tuning, used a RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV for the tuning and see if the performance can be enhanced.
•	Evaluated a model under using cross validation for Precision, Recall and F1 score and used ROC curve, Confusion Matrix and Classification report to have a glance beyond Accuracy metric we used.
•	Used a coefficient of different columns on our data set to check which feature was important to predict a heart-disease
•	Finally gained a 90% accuracy on Test Data using Logistic Regression
